This means they have very strict numbers for their license, and it is highly likely that it will be a sell-out as it is every year. If there are tickets left, they will be available on the day, but there is no guarantee of availability and they will be a slightly higher price too.

                "question": "Disabled Access Information?",
                "answer": "<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Getting Around</span></strong>Electric wheelchairs can tackle most areas without too much hindrance but the ground can be quite uneven in places and is predominantly on grass. If it rains it may get muddy and access around the site (other than on the paths) may be very difficult. The terrain is predominantly short grass with firm soil so movement around the main arena and other stages is possible for fit wheelchair users in good weather. &nbsp;Your personal assistant will need to assist you if it becomes difficult, which is why they receive a free pass to the festival.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Chilling out</span></strong>The festival recognise that some, particularly those with specific learning difficulties may need to find a space to step away from the crowds and noise. &nbsp;The organisers do their best to provide this but it is difficult in a festival environment but they always aim to do their best.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Camping - Disability Access Campsite</span></strong>The Disability Access Camping Area is positioned near to the main Lulworth Castle entrance and to the Main Stage. It is a few minutes from here to the main arena on relatively flat ground and is one of the quietest and closest to the arenas. &nbsp;It is the best location we can achieve for all of the needs of people who the festival try to accommodate. &nbsp;Please note that you should prepare to bring a tent or campervan that will fit in &nbsp;7m x 5m space as that is very likely to be your allocation. &nbsp;Of course, those who require a little more space will be helped if there is space available.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>NB</strong></span>: Your family and friends can camp with you in the Accessibility camping area but your group including the person with a disability, a personal assistant and children can be a maximum of 6 people. Other people with disabilities who are your friends and family should apply separately.&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Parking</span></strong>Those in the Accessibility campsite will need to follow signs for Accessibility Camping - this is accessed via the Main Lulworth Castle Gates. Only vehicles with a blue badge (or similar) can park in the disability access camping area if there is available space and if your tent and car fit in the 7m x 5m space. &nbsp;If not, you will be asked to park in the nearby car park. &nbsp;Only one vehicle is allowed in the camping area and this includes motorhomes.If you are in General Admission Camping, Boutique camping, Campervan Field or camping Plus, they have separate car parks for you to use and there are no special allowances for Blue Badge holders as the car parks are first-come, first-served.A car park for the day visiting persons with a disability without a blue badge is close by and accessible throughout the weekend. Friends will have to park in the main car park, however. Day parking is also available.&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Facilities</span></strong>Please note that the festival is in a field where normal home-type levels of facilities are just not possible. The organisers do their absolute best but sometimes vehicles get stuck in traffic, things break or don't work and we'll be doing our best to fix it, and of course look to improve each year with newer available facilities.* Please note that facilities for those with mobility difficulties such as showers and toilets should NOT be used by your other guests. &nbsp;It's very important that we keep these facilities for those who need them most. &nbsp;Those with disabilities are our priority in this campsite.&nbsp;- Charging points for electric wheelchairs are available - these are undercover but outdoors so can be affected by damp conditions so chargers are left at users risk- Certain medical support is available from the on-site medical centre but any specific medical needs should be discussed before purchasing a ticket.&nbsp;- On-site hospital. &nbsp;We have a hospital on site but it is NOT a residential hospital. &nbsp;No-one should be left in our on-site hospital overnight, or be left unattended by a personal assistant if in this environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;- Accessible lavatories will be positioned at various places around the festival and we aim to protect them from public use. &nbsp;Please check out where they are on site so you know where to go when you need to go.- In the Accessibility campsite, showers and toilets are provided- Stewards will be on hand to help with any issues that may arise during the weekend- We do not supply motability buggies or any other form of onsite transport so you will need to bring your own if it is needed- We do not supply medical equipment or essential medical supplies so you will need to bring these yourself or arrange delivery to Lulworth castle.- At the time of writing, we do not have viewing platforms at Camp Bestival as there are elevated positions for viewing&nbsp;If you have any pressing questions that are not answered here above, please email disabilityaccess@campbestival.net"

With tokens, this is dramatically sped up, with tokens being taken and items&nbsp;being passed to the customer, which takes around 20/30 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our token system also minimises the risk of COVID-19 transmission.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>For full FAQ's please visit: https://rockthemote.com/faqs</strong>"

To strike a balance, Party at the Park does allow people to bring in camping chairs however they will not be allowed to be positioned directly in front of the stage. There will be a &lsquo;chair free zone&rsquo; in a stewarded area around 50 metres from the stage. There is a very large area beyond that in which you are welcome to &lsquo;park&rsquo; your seating for the whole day and you can then of course move closer to the stage when you fancy getting into the thick of it and retiring back to your seats again &ndash; just like at the dancin! We would also ask you to think of the environment and take your chairs home with you."

Electric wheelchairs can tackle most areas without too much trouble but the ground can be uneven in places. Please bear this in mind when attending the event and come prepared for all weather conditions.There are some pathways located in the arena areas, but the majority of the festival is on short grass with firm soil.Please note we do not offer any internal transport due to the limitations of moving around the site.There are around 15 different stages and performance areas, which are located in the main arenas.<h3>BOOKABLE ACCESS FACILITIES</h3>All of our Access Facilities can be booked online through the Camp Bestival Shropshire Accessibility Application form.

However if young people have official identification to prove they are over the age of 18 they will of course be served legally."
