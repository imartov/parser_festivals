Please be sensible as the campsite has no electric facilities and you will not be able to plug in a mini fridge, so any food should be non-refrigerated. Please do not bring excess food onto the campsite as it may be confiscated. With regards to alcohol drinks, bring no more than a reasonable amount per person over 18.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please note, glass bottles, glass containers and any form of glass will not be permitted on site at any time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>BBQs are also not allowed - this is a working farm and, to comply with fire safety risk assessment,&nbsp;BBQs (disposable or otherwise), fire pits, candles, and any item with a naked flame are not permitted onsite.</p>",
