                    "answer": "<p>You can indeed! Parking at Kelburn is limited therefore ticketed. Advance Parking Tickets can be purchased for &pound;27.50 + BF along with your event ticket. We recommend booking in advance for two reasons: it&rsquo;s cheaper than purchasing onsite (&pound;35) and it avoids disappointment if we sell out!</p>\r\n<p>If you are planning to drive you must book a parking ticket.</p>\r\n<p>We regularly sell out of parking. Parking will only be available for purchase onsite if we do not sell out in advance, we&rsquo;ll be sure to advertise when we&rsquo;re running low on Advance Parking Tickets.</p>\r\n<p>Please do not park in nearby streets in Fairlie or Largs, it leads to frustration from our neighbours and could have a negative impact on the future of the festival. We like our neighbours and want to show them respect.</p>\r\n<p>If your vehicle has a blue badge we can also try to park you closer to where you are camped &ndash; please note you will still need to purchase a parking ticket.</p>\r\n<p>We price our Parking to encourage lift sharing and use of public transport</p>",
