This means that art and decor take the place of ubiquitous advertising and the international big names on the mainstage don't drown out the voices of the hidden gems.</p>\r\n<p>Solfest is all about eclecticism and although nothing shouts that louder than our handpicked line-ups, spanning genres and eras of music, that most certainly isn't where it stops. A broad group of very talented people come together each year at Solfest, to create an immersive environment with everything from a creative kid's area, to an array of interactive site art and even a Healing Garden where you can meditate, do some Yoga or participate in a Shamanic ritual!</p>\r\n<p>Solfest is founded on the idea that what truly makes a festival great is the crowd... That's right,<strong> YOU.</strong> You are our driving force and over the years we've been proud to see that the spirit of inclusion we strive for has not been lost to the Solfest community. Punks and ravers, grannies and toddlers, whoever you are or wherever you're from, Solfest has something for you.&nbsp;The fans own Solfest, whether you're a musician looking to play, a performer looking to show off your skills, an artist keen to help make the space come alive or you're simply looking for somewhere to dance, your collaboration defines the festival.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
